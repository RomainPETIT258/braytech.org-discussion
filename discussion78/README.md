# Goals
Create a database and a map of deepsight locations.
Eventually that can be used for bray.tech

# Future goals
Create a collaborative tool that allow everyone to contribute to this map.
Not only for deepsights locations.
For development use only. It will be quicker and a way more efficient to get locations and may be integrated into Bray.tech later if its owner want this

## How to
- A tool to retrieve maps from Bungie API
- A tool Map in a web browser to add remarkable points.
- Database on a .json file
- Github project to persist datas
